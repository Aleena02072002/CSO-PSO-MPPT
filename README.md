This project is used to compare the efficiency of 2 algorithms: Partical Swarm Optimization and Cuckoo Search Algorithm in Maximun Power Point tracking (MPPT) of a PV module system (solar panel) under partial shading condition.
The result points out that PSO are more effiecient in tracking maximum power comparing to CSA.
